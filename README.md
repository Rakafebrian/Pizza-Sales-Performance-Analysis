# Pizza Sales Dataset Analysis

# Overview Project
This project analyzes pizza sales data using SQL for data querying and Power BI for visualization. The dataset used includes order details such as date, time, quantity, price, category, and pizza size. The analysis focuses on calculating important Key Performance Indicators and creating interactive charts to understand sales trends, customer preferences, and performance metrics. The goal of this project is to help pizza businesses optimize operations, identify best-selling products, and find areas for improvement. 

# Problem Statement
1. How many customers do we have each day? Are there any peak hours?
2. How many pizzas are typically in an order? Do we have any bestsellers?
3. How much money did we make this year? Can we indentify any seasonality in the sales?
4. Are there any pizzas we should take of the menu, or any promotions we could leverage?

# Objective
1. Identify the number of customers each day and find the peak sales hours.
2. Find out the average number of pizzas in each order and determine the best-selling menu items.
3. Calculate total revenue for the year and analyze seasonal patterns in sales.
4. Evaluate less popular pizza menu items and formulate potential promotional strategies to increase sales.
